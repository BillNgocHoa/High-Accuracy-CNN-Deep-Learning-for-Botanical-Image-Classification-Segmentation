## Deep Vision: Building CNNs from Scratch & Fine-Tuning for Flower Classification & Segmentation

This project applies **Deep Learning for computer vision** to solve two real-world image analysis tasks:  
1. **Multiclass Flower Classification** ‚Äì identifying 17 species of flowers.  
2. **Semantic Segmentation** ‚Äì detecting and isolating flower regions from the background.  

It combines a **scratch-built CNN** for classification and a **fine-tuned pretrained DeepLabv3+** model for segmentation.  
The work demonstrates how **custom CNN architectures** and **transfer learning** can both be effective for solving vision problems on small datasets.

  - Oxford 17 Flowers dataset reorganized into class folders.
  - DaffodilSeg subset prepared for segmentation; non-flower labels remapped to background.
  - 80/20 training-validation split with balanced classes.

- **Data Augmentation**
  - Rotations (¬±40¬∞), translations (¬±20%), scaling (80‚Äì120%), shearing, and horizontal flips.
  - Standardized input size to **256√ó256√ó3**.

- **Classification Model**
  - Custom CNN with **4 Conv-ReLU-MaxPool blocks** (32‚Äì256 filters), dropout (0.3 & 0.5), fully connected layers, and softmax output.
  - Trained for **80 epochs** with Adam optimizer (`lr=1e-4`, batch size=32).

- **Segmentation Model**
  - Fine-tuned **DeepLabv3+** with **ResNet-18** backbone.
  - Binary segmentation (flower vs background).
  - Trained for **50 epochs** with Adam optimizer (`lr=1e-4`, batch size=8).

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Intersection-over-Union (IoU), boundary F-score.
  - Confusion matrices for classification and segmentation.
